## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

### Acceptance Prediction Model

- **Model Type:** XGBoost Binary Classifier
- **Target:** Predict if host will accept an inquiry
- **Performance:** 85% ROC-AUC
- **Features:** Response time, guest count, trip length, seasonality, lead time

#### Top Predictive Features:
1. Number of messages exchanged
2. Lead time (days in advance)
3. Host response time
4. Trip duration
5. Check-in day of week

#### Business Impact:
- Identify high-probability bookings for dynamic pricing
- Train hosts on factors that increase acceptance
- Optimize matching algorithm

## 📈 Key Analyses

### 1. Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

**Method:** Aggregated search volume vs confirmed bookings by trip length

**Finding:** 
- **3-5 night stays:** 21,456 searches → 9,123 bookings (57.5% gap)
- **Revenue opportunity:** €2M+ in unmet demand

**Recommendation:** Incentivize hosts to accept mid-length stays

---

### 2. Host Performance Benchmarking

**Method:** Calculated acceptance, reply, and booking rates per host

**Finding:**
- Top 10% of hosts: 85%+ acceptance rate
- Average hosts: 45% acceptance rate
- Fast responders (<1hr): 23% higher acceptance

**Recommendation:** Train hosts on best practices from top performers

---

### 3. Conversion Funnel Optimization

**Method:** Tracked inquiry → reply → acceptance → booking stages

**Finding:**
- **Inquiry → Reply:** 67% drop-off (biggest leak)
- **Reply → Acceptance:** 41% drop-off
- **Acceptance → Booking:** 15% drop-off

**Recommendation:** Focus on improving host reply rates first
